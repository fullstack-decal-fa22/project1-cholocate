                <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
                Senior at UC Berkeley with an aspiration to learn, understand, and teach!
                Not sure where I am heading, but as long as I am moving forward, I am sure
                I will be fine!

            <h2> My Experience </h2> 
                Previously an AI for CS61B and CS61C, I enjoy working with staffs and students 
                to get a better understanding of what I am teaching and learn some things along 
                the way! Last Fall I interned at FPT software as a SWE, and had the chance to work 
                with my team and design a database schema and automate migration.
